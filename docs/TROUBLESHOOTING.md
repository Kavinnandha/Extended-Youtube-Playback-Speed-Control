#### Application Tab Storage
1. Developer Tools ‚Üí Application tab

4. Check if values are being saved/updated

### Manifest and Permission Issues

#### Check Extension Details

2. Click "Details" on YouTube Speed Extender
3. Check permissions granted
4. Verify "Allow access to file URLs" if needed

#### Permission Problems

### Browser-Specific Issues

### Extension Conflicts

#### Common Conflicting Extensions

- **uBlock Origin**: Rarely blocks extension scripts
- **Grammarly**: Can interfere with keyboard events

#### Identifying Conflicts
1. Disable all other extensions
2. Test YouTube Speed Extender alone
3. Re-enable extensions one by one
4. Note when problem returns

#### Resolving Conflicts
- **Use only one speed control extension**
